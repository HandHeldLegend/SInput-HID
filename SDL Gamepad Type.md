# SDL Gamepad Types
Note from SDL library: 

This type does not necessarily map to first-party controllers from Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo; in many cases, third-party controllers can report as these, either because they were designed for a specific console, or they simply most closely match that console's controllers (does it have A/B/X/Y buttons or X/O/Square/Triangle? Does it have a touchpad? etc).
